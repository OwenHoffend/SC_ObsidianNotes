Notes:
This paper seeks to implement general polynomials similarly to existing SC research papers, except take advantage of some of the functions that can be constructed using correlation-based components, specifically the saturating subtractor: ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png), which uses ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.png), and the saturating adder: ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.png) which uses ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.png), and the absolute-valued subtractor, which uses ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.png). The paper is quite long and dense, as they go through many different polynomial types such as positive/negative coefficients, different powers, etc. Generally, the circuit structures involve creative use of D-flipflop-based decorrelators to maintain independence between bitstreams that need to be multiplied, while other bitstreams are allowed to be correlated or anti-correlated as necessary in order to implement saturating addition/subtraction. For example, the following circuit implements the polynomial function ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.png):

In the circuit, ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image015.png) and ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image017.png) are independent, whereas ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image017.png) and ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image019.png) are anti-correlated. It can be shown that if ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image017.png) and ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image019.png) have ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.png), then the AND-gate product ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image021.png) is also anti-correlated with ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image019.png). We can work around the fact that the addition is saturating by ensuring that the bitstreams are sufficiently long. As another example, the following circuit implements a polynomial approximation to ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image023.png). Unlike existing polynomial-based designs, all coefficient are generated by the same

There is a lot of diversity in these polynomial SC circuits, and I think they would be an interesting application to analyze both from the perspective of COMAX as well as the perspective of early termination. These are relatively small multi-layer correlation-dependent circuits that could benefit from our optimization. The one issue is that the sequential delay elements might present somewhat of a challenge. One solution is to consider all nets on the output side of a DFF as an ideal (primary) variable input for the purposes of applying COMAX. Alternatively, I wonder if it’s worth trying to extend the notion of stochastic equivalence to include PTMs with delays?

From the perspective of early termination, I expect these correlation-based polynomial circuits to not require bitstreams nearly as long as those required by the conventional ![](file:///C:/Users/owenh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image026.png) type designs. They would be interesting to evaluate in terms of dynamic early termination, since the desired function is well defined.
