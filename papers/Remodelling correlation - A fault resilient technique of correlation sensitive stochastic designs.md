Summary:
This paper analyzes multi-layer SC design from the standpoint of soft errors (random bit flips) and SCC. They provide a method to correct errors due to random bit flips involving modifying the input SCC. By writing the input PTV (for a two-input circuit) as a function of the SCC, and multiplying by the PTM (which factors in the error probability), they can solve for the optimal input SCC that minimizes the output error probability. 

Pretty cool.
This paper has a lot of good examples of applying PTM-type math in context.
